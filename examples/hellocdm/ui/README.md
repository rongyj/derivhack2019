# DAML App Template

## Prerequisites

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

## Quick Start

Follow the quick start instructions in the [parent folder](../), which leaves you with a running ledger and a single `Transfer` contract on it.

Install the Javascript dependencies:
```sh
yarn install
```

Start up the development server:
```sh
yarn start
```

This opens a browser page pointing to `http://localhost:3000/#/login`.

Login as `Alice` (case sensitive), leaving the password blank.

You are now redirected to `http://localhost:3000/#/app/default` where you see the contract listed with an explorable JSON tree in the `Argument` column. This the default view implemented in [src/pages/default/Default.js](src/pages/Default.js), which uses the `Contracts` React component's defaults. It is useful to explore a contracts data to determine which fields to display.

In the report tab you can see a ledger view with specific fields displayed for the contract, a textfield and button to exercise a choice. It is implemented in [src/pages/report/Report.js](src/pages/report/Report.js), where you can see how custom columns and actions can be passed to the `Contracts` component.

You can now enter a new greeting message and hit `Enter` to exercise the `SayHello` choice on the contract. Notice how the `Identifier` and `Version` values change when you do that.

By modifying this template application you can now create custom reports as required for the hackathon.

## Running against DABL

Three changes are required once you've deployed your DAML application to the DABL cloud.

1. You have to switch the `isLocalDev` flag to `false` and copy the tokens for each party into the `DABL config` section in [src/config.js](src/config.js), which you can obtain from the DABL Ledger Settings page for your ledger.

2. You will need to copy the JWT tokens from DABL Ledger Settings for the parties you would like to use and paste them in the `dablConfig.tokens` object in [src/config.js](src/config.js)

3. Finally, you'll need to change the `proxy` config entry in [package.json](package.json) to point to the DABL API endpoint, which is also listed on the DABL Ledger Settings page for your ledger.

You can now run `yarn start` again and your application will work against the deployed DABL ledger.

Note that DABL uses obfuscated party names on the ledger, so you'll have to maintain a mapping between your defined party names and the DABL ones if you want to display parties in the UI. You can find out the mapping by looking at the `DABL.User:UserParty` contracts in the DABL Live Data view or copy the obfuscated party names to your clipboard from the DABL Ledger Settings.
